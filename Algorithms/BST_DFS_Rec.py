# Binary Search Tree : Depth First Search : Recursive (O(n))

# Explores one branch in its entirety before moving to the next branch
# Is stack based. Hence either the call stack is used ( Recursion ), or an explicit stack ( Iterative )

# Split into 3 types which affect the order of which the tree is traversed

# PreOrder



# InOrder



# PostOrder
