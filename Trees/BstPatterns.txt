Invert Binary Tree
Trees
Template:
- Take root node
- Swap Left and Right nodes
- Recursively call function on child nodes
Mistakes:
- don't forget edge cases like an empty tree
- remember to call self on the parent function

Max Depth of Binary Tree
Trees
Template:
- Recursive DFS
- + 1 each node visited
- use max() function to determine whether left or right results in bigger number

- Iterative BFS
- use a deque for order
- while q isn't empty, pop from left, append to right
- append left first, then append right.
- Use an integer variable to keep track of the levels

- Iterative DFS
- use a stack to store next nodes to be searched
- store both depth and node paired in the stack
- preorder is easiest iterative dfs to implement
Mistakes:
- Don't forget empty tree edgecase

Binary Tree Diameter
Trees 
Template:
Recursive DFS
- global variable for result
- create a nested function
- left, right, then compute res
- return 1 + max of left and right
Mistakes
- ensure that res is global (either self.res or nonlocal res before call)
- remember to call dfs on the root to start recursion
- don't forget empty node edge case
